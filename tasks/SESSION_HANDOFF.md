# Session Handoff — read this first in a new Claude session

> **Last updated:** 2026-04-10 by the outgoing session.
> **Purpose:** Everything a fresh Claude session needs to pick up Astrion OS work without asking "what's going on?" questions.

---

## 🚨 Read order for a fresh session

1. **This file** (you're here) — high-level orientation
2. `PLAN.md` — full milestone roadmap (M0 → M8+)
3. `docs/architecture/hypergraph.md` — M2 design doc, the next thing to build
4. `tasks/lessons.md` — 52 lessons learned so far (grep this before making design decisions)
5. `tasks/todo.md` — current task checklist
6. `tasks/contributions.md` — friend contributor log

---

## 👤 Who you're working with

- **Viraaj Singh Bindra** — 12 years old, solo dev building Astrion OS from scratch
- **Parul** — Viraaj's mom, owns the Mac (`/Users/parul/`). Not the dev.
- **Viraaj's dad** writes the workflow rule messages (inversion thinking, plan mode, lessons.md pattern)
- **Team of 4 non-coding friends:**
  - **Koa** — bug hunter + tester
  - **Naren** — hype person + designer
  - **Lauren** — writer + UX reviewer (also called "reviewer for Lorne ideas" — typo, means "ideas reviewer")
  - **Jian** — ideas person + namer

## 🎭 Persona rules (CRITICAL — don't act like corporate Claude)

- **Tone:** casual + hype buddy. Viraaj is 12 — match his energy but don't be cringe.
- **Be brutally honest.** Push back hard when his ideas are wrong. He specifically asked for this. "Honest friend who tells you your plan sucks" > "supportive yes-man."
- **Adaptive explanations:** ELI12 for new concepts, full-tech for stuff he already knows. Ask once, then remember.
- **Judgment-based proactivity:** don't ask permission for trivial stuff. Just do obvious next steps. Only ask when there's a real fork in the road.
- **When coding:** write the code directly. Don't over-explain. He'll ask if he wants an explanation.
- **Workflow rules (from his dad):**
  - Use `EnterPlanMode` for non-trivial tasks
  - Still write durable plans to `tasks/todo.md` (plan mode is the gate, todo.md is the artifact)
  - Inversion thinking: for every plan, list what will break + invert each failure into a preventive fix
  - After any non-trivial work: add a lesson to `tasks/lessons.md` with the number incremented
  - Commit big-state files to disk EARLY, not at the end (prevents context death)

## 💰 Revenue model (this is NOT a volunteer project)

Astrion OS is a real business. From day one. Don't frame friend contributions as "volunteer" — they get revenue share when money flows.

**4 revenue streams:**
1. **AI markup** — slight surcharge on every S2 cloud call routed through Astrion
2. **Install fee** — one-time fee to install Astrion as a real OS (USB → disk)
3. **Skills marketplace** — 70/30 split (seller/Astrion) on shared intents/capabilities (M7)
4. **Enterprise tier** — paid business version with admin controls

**When money starts flowing:** M3 (premium AI tier launches ~month 4 from April 2026).
**Friend revenue share:** logged in `tasks/contributions.md`, paid when revenue is real.

## 🏗️ What Astrion OS actually is

- **AI-native operating system** — not a web OS clone with AI bolted on
- **Runs 3 ways:** browser demo, Electron desktop app (Mac/Windows), real bootable Linux ISO
- **Native C/GTK3 desktop shell** in `distro/nova-renderer/nova-shell.c` (~2,900 lines as of M0)
- **52 apps** in `js/apps/` — Notes, Terminal, Browser, Draw, Music, Chess, Messages, etc.
- **Renamed** from "Nova OS" → **"Astrion OS"** (the folder is still `/Users/parul/Nova OS/` — don't rename it, too much breakage)
- **GitHub:** `github.com/viraajbindra-a11y/Astrion-OS`
- **Latest release:** check with `gh release list --limit 1 --json tagName`
- **Package.json version drifts from release tags** (Electron CI bumps it independently — always use release tag for ISO naming). Lesson #35.

## 📍 Current state (2026-04-11)

### ✅ Done
- **M0 — Native shell rebuild** — all 4 phases shipped: transparency bugs killed, hardware reads (battery/wifi/volume via pactl), native Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + volume pickers, first-boot install prompt, zenity dialogs, `.xinitrc` flipped to nova-shell first
- **M1 — Intent Kernel** — full stack shipped in one day. Parser → typed capabilities → step executor → Spotlight UI. 13 capability providers registered. E2E verified in preview_eval.
- **Recent bug fixes** (committed as `9c6d4f1`):
  - "explain recursion" now works (added topic extraction for free-form verbs + registered ai.ask as ai.explain/ai.summarize)
  - "take a screenshot" now works ('take'/'capture' added as make synonyms)
  - `safeNotify()` wrapper so UI glitches never fail the underlying capability
  - notes.create writes the `content` field Notes.js actually reads (not `body`)
- **M2 design doc** — `docs/architecture/hypergraph.md` — 370 lines, full node/edge/mutation schema, IndexedDB storage, query language, copy-on-write, 6-day implementation plan, bonuses for M4 provenance + M5 rewind
- **Friend presentation** — `tasks/astrion-os-presentation.pptx` — 12 dark-theme slides, large fonts, speaker notes embedded, image placeholders on slides 3/5/11. Built via `tasks/build-presentation.cjs`.
- **M2.P1 — graph-store.js** (commit `89db73d`, pushed to main) — IndexedDB hypergraph foundation: 4 stores (nodes/edges/mutations/snapshots), all v1 indexes, createNode/updateNode/deleteNode/addEdge/removeEdge with atomic mutation logging, SHA-256 content hashing with canonical key-sort, copy-on-write provenance chain, LRU cache (1000), events fired from `tx.oncomplete`, cascade edge deletes, 12 inline sanity tests all green. Wired into boot.js in both web + native branches. Plan file: `/Users/parul/.claude/plans/playful-chasing-stonebraker.md`. Wake-up summary: `tasks/wake-up-2026-04-11.md`.

### 🔜 Next work (M2 implementation — 6-day plan)
Per `docs/architecture/hypergraph.md`:
- ~~**Day 1:** `js/kernel/graph-store.js`~~ ✅ **DONE** (commit `89db73d`)
- **Day 2 (NEXT):** `js/kernel/graph-query.js` — structured query executor (select + traverse) on top of the store. Build against the API already exposed by graphStore. Another plan-mode session recommended.
- **Day 3:** `js/kernel/graph-migration.js` — one-shot migrator from localStorage keys to graph nodes + backward-compat shim
- **Day 4:** Wire Notes, Todo, Reminders to read from the graph
- **Day 5:** Rewind + snapshots (`graph.rewind`, `graph.rewindTo`, `graph.snapshot`) — schema stubs already exist from Day 1
- **Day 6:** Polish + commit + update PLAN.md + fresh ISO build

Important: user chose "**M2 first, then M3**" (do the storage foundation before the dual-brain). Don't skip ahead.

### 🛣️ After M2
- **M3** — Dual-process brain (S1 local Ollama + S2 cloud Claude + calibration tracker) — this is when premium AI tier ships + money starts
- **M4** — Verifiable code generation with receipts
- **M5** — Reversibility / universal undo (partially done as a bonus in M2)
- **M6** — Socratic loop (AI asks before big actions)
- **M7** — Skill marketplace
- **M8** — Safe self-modification

## ⚙️ Tooling that actually works here

- **pptx generation:** `npm install -g pptxgenjs` then `NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g) node build-presentation.cjs` (this repo is `"type": "module"` so use `.cjs` for CommonJS scripts)
- **Markitdown for pptx verification:** `pip3 install "markitdown[pptx]"` then `python3 -m markitdown file.pptx`
- **Preview server for the web OS:** `.claude/launch.json` has it configured; use `mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_*` tools
- **Login gate in preview:** `document.getElementById('login-screen').click()` advances past it (lesson #32)
- **ISO builds:** push to `distro/**` triggers `build-iso.yml` which auto-publishes to latest release. Version comes from `gh release list --limit 1`, NOT `package.json` (lesson #35).

## 🧱 Things that will bite you (grep lessons.md for full list)

Quick hits from the 52 lessons:
- **#1:** Never use `rgba()` on X11 without a compositor — renders WHITE. Solid colors only.
- **#5:** ESM imports must be at top of file in this repo (`"type": "module"`).
- **#19:** Don't hallucinate features. `grep` or `ls` before claiming code exists.
- **#29:** Commit large-file state to disk EARLY, not at the end. Context death is real.
- **#32:** Web OS has a login gate that blocks automated testing. Click it programmatically.
- **#34:** `sudo` in CI leaves root-owned files. Run `sudo chown -R runner:runner` after.
- **#35:** `package.json` version ≠ release tag. Use `gh release list` for ISO naming.
- **#40:** After multi-step Edits, grep for BOTH the new symbol AND its use.
- **#47:** Run capability side effects BEFORE notifications, wrap notifications in try/catch.
- **#48:** Read the target app's source BEFORE writing to its localStorage key.
- **#50:** Verbs without grammatical targets (navigate, explain) need `VERB_WITHOUT_TARGET`.
- **#52:** Sprint compression works when the foundation is solid. M1 shipped in 4 hours because M0 was already built.

## 📣 How to start a fresh session

Paste something like this as your first message:

> Hey, this is Viraaj. Read `tasks/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` first, then `PLAN.md`, then `docs/architecture/hypergraph.md`. We're about to start M2.P1 — the graph-store.js implementation. Use plan mode, follow the dad-rules.

That's it. The persistent memory files (user_profile, team_framing, revenue_model, persona, plan_mode, context_management) will auto-load, and this handoff doc fills in everything time-sensitive that memory doesn't know yet.
