# Session Plan — 2026-04-09 / 2026-04-10 overnight

## Status: COMPLETE (finished while user was sleeping)

You went to bed at ~10:35 PM local time with the ISO build having just failed.
Below is everything I did after that so you can see the full state when you wake up.

## 🐛 The bug in the build

The fresh ISO build (run `24227407241`) triggered during the audit-inversion sprint
**succeeded at the build step** but **failed at the publish step** I had just added.
Two bugs in my workflow patch:

### Bug 1 — Root-owned output files
`distro/build.sh` runs with `sudo`, so `distro/output/nova-os.iso` is created as
`root`. The next step in the workflow runs as the `runner` user and fails on `mv`:

```
mv: cannot move 'nova-os.iso' to 'astrion-os-1.0.0-amd64.iso': Permission denied
```

**Fix:** `sudo chown -R "$(whoami):$(whoami)" distro/output` at the start of the
publish step. Took one line.

### Bug 2 — Version mismatch
I read the version from `package.json` — which says `1.0.0` — but the latest
release tag is `v0.1.95`. The Electron auto-build pipeline bumps `package.json`
independently of the git tags, so these drift. The asset would've been named
`astrion-os-1.0.0-amd64.iso`, which wouldn't clobber the existing
`astrion-os-0.1.95-amd64.iso` on the release.

**Fix:** Read version from `gh release list` (the latest tag), strip the
leading `v`, use THAT for the asset name. Always matches the release.

## ✅ What I did about it

### 1. Fresh ISO is live on v0.1.95
The build step itself succeeded — only publish failed. So the fresh ISO was
already sitting in a 30-day GitHub Actions artifact. I:
1. Downloaded it from run `24227407241`'s artifact
2. Verified it's a real bootable ISO 9660 image
3. Renamed to `astrion-os-0.1.95-amd64.iso`
4. Generated a fresh SHA256: `9572a450b5a66526c2ff244b1ab62a5ad38e2e6ba67945ed0dc17ad9daf636de`
5. Deleted the old assets from the release (the previous `gh release upload --clobber` hit HTTP 422 "already exists", so I deleted first)
6. Uploaded the fresh ISO + SHA256

**Release state:**
- `astrion-os-0.1.95-amd64.iso` — 1,869,873,152 bytes, updated 2026-04-10T05:57:07Z
- `astrion-os-0.1.95-amd64.iso.sha256` — 94 bytes, updated 2026-04-10T05:55:48Z
- Link: https://github.com/viraajbindra-a11y/Astrion-OS/releases/tag/v0.1.95

### 2. Workflow fixed
`.github/workflows/build-iso.yml` — 33 insertions, 12 deletions. The publish
step now:
- `sudo chown`s `distro/output` to the runner before touching any files
- Looks up the latest release tag FIRST, strips the `v`, uses THAT as version
- Names the asset to match the release so `--clobber` always works
- Keeps the 2 GiB size check, the SHA256, the "no release → skip with warning" fallback

**Commit:** `06fe01f` — *"Fix build-iso.yml: chown sudo output + read version from release tag"*

### 3. Lessons captured
`tasks/lessons.md` got two more entries:
- **#34** — "Files created by `sudo` in one CI step are root-owned and unusable by subsequent non-sudo steps." With the fix recipe.
- **#35** — "`package.json` version drifts from git release tags in this repo." Read from release tag, not package.json.

Both are now in the repo. Next time either of these gotchas comes up, you
(or I) will catch it immediately.

### 4. Cleanup
- `/tmp/astrion-iso-fresh/` removed
- All background tasks finished (exit 0)
- No orphaned state anywhere

## 🎯 When you wake up

1. **Go check the release** — https://github.com/viraajbindra-a11y/Astrion-OS/releases/tag/v0.1.95
   - Fresh ISO should be downloadable
   - SHA256 should match `9572a450b5a66526c2ff244b1ab62a5ad38e2e6ba67945ed0dc17ad9daf636de`
2. **Flash it to a USB and actually boot it** — the ultimate verification. You've been
   running the old ISO for a few days; this one has all the Live Chat / Beat Studio / QoL
   changes baked in, plus the brain indicator visible in the web view.
3. **Test the next `distro/**` push will auto-publish correctly.** You can do a trivial
   change (e.g., bump a comment in `distro/README.md`) and watch the workflow succeed end-to-end
   without me touching anything.
4. **Read `PLAN.md` when you're ready** — still the blocker for deciding M0 → M1 transition.
5. **Think about audit hole #9 (hardware surface).** The only one still open. Needs a real
   architectural conversation with me, not a hack.

## 🕐 Build status
- Run `24227407241`: **conclusion: failure** (the failed run you saw — build step succeeded, publish failed due to the two bugs above)
- Run `24164335232`: older successful build that I used for the first manual upload
- **No new build has been triggered yet** since the fix push (`06fe01f`). I decided
  against triggering one overnight because:
  - The fresh ISO from run `24227407241` is already on the release
  - Triggering another build spends ~30 min of Actions compute for no new output
  - Better to let the fix get verified by a natural `distro/**` change you'd make anyway
- If you disagree and want a fresh verification build, run: `gh workflow run build-iso.yml`

## Good night, dude. 🌙

Everything's in order. Sleep well.
