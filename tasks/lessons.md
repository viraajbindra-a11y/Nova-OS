# Astrion OS — Lessons Learned

## Architecture
1. **Never use RGBA transparency without a compositor.** All `rgba()` in CSS and `gdk_screen_get_rgba_visual()` in C render as WHITE on X11 without compositing. Use solid colors only.
2. **`gtk_window_fullscreen()` needs a window manager.** Without a WM, use `gtk_window_resize(w, screen_width, screen_height)` + `gtk_window_move(w, 0, 0)` instead.
3. **`gtk_window_begin_move_drag()` needs a WM.** Without a WM, implement manual drag via motion-notify-event.
4. **GDK_SCALE=2 + GDK_DPI_SCALE compound.** Don't use both — GDK_SCALE alone handles HiDPI for native shell. Web content zoom is separate (webkit_web_view_set_zoom_level).
5. **ESM imports must be at the top of the file.** `import { X } from 'y'` inside a function or try/catch block crashes Node.js in ESM mode.
6. **C forward declarations required.** If function A calls function B and B is defined after A, add `static void B(...)` declaration at the top.
7. **C++ lambda syntax (`+[](...){}`) doesn't work in C.** Use named callback functions.
8. **A web page is NOT an operating system.** Users notice Ctrl+R, right-click menus, scroll bounce, and other browser behaviors. A native shell with WebKitGTK app windows is the right architecture.

## Live ISO
9. **Live ISOs lose ALL state on reboot.** localStorage, Wi-Fi profiles, settings — everything is in RAM overlay. Install to disk for persistence.
10. **System clock is wrong on live boot.** NTP needs internet, internet needs Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi needs manual setup. Use `ntpdate -u` (UDP, no SSL) in .xinitrc.
11. **DNS must be set explicitly.** Live ISOs often have empty `/etc/resolv.conf`. Write `nameserver 8.8.8.8` before anything network-dependent.
12. **SSL cert errors = wrong clock.** If `curl` fails with cert error (code 60), fix the date first: `sudo date -s "2026-04-07 12:00:00"`.

## Surface Pro 6
13. **Marvell Wi-Fi needs `firmware-misc-nonfree`.** The AVASTAR chip doesn't work without proprietary firmware blobs.
14. **Surface Pro 6 is 2736x1824 at 267 DPI.** Without scaling, everything is microscopic. GDK_SCALE=2 for native GTK, webkit_web_view_set_zoom_level(1.75) for web content.
15. **The `-nocursor` flag on `startx` permanently hides the cursor.** Don't use it. Use `xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr` instead.
16. **`prompt()` may be blocked in WebKitGTK.** Use custom HTML dialogs instead of JavaScript `prompt()`, `confirm()`, `alert()`.

## Development
17. **`sudo nova-update` only updates web files (JS/CSS/HTML).** Compiled C binaries need a new ISO build or manual recompile on the device.
18. **Test on real hardware, not just in the browser.** Many features (battery, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, audio) only work on the ISO.
19. **Don't hallucinate features.** Always verify with `grep` or `ls` that code actually exists before claiming it works.
20. **Cancel and retrigger builds rather than waiting for stale ones.** If you push a fix after triggering a build, the running build doesn't have the fix.

## Releases & ISO Publishing
21. **The `build-iso.yml` workflow only uploads to Actions artifacts, not to Releases.** Artifacts expire in 30 days and require login to download. For public distribution, the ISO must be manually uploaded to the Release via `gh release upload`. Fix pending: patch the workflow to auto-publish to release on tag push.
22. **Before publishing a stale ISO artifact, verify no `distro/` commits since the build.** Use `git log --oneline <artifact-sha>..HEAD -- distro/` — if it's empty, the ISO's shell/C code is still current. If non-empty, trigger a fresh build first.
23. **Always ship a SHA256 alongside any ISO.** Users need to verify integrity. `shasum -a 256 file.iso | tee file.iso.sha256` then upload both.
24. **GitHub release assets are hard-capped at 2 GB per file.** Check ISO size before attempting upload: `ls -lh file.iso`. Astrion ISO is 1.86 GB — safe, but close to the cap.
25. **Use `gh release upload --clobber` for new assets, not for replacing unrelated existing ones.** `--clobber` only overwrites assets with the same filename, leaves others alone.
26. **Name release assets with the product name + version + arch.** `astrion-os-0.1.95-amd64.iso`, not `nova-os.iso`. Makes the filename self-documenting and matches the current brand.

## Plan / Workflow
27. **The built-in `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` exists and is tighter than free-form plans in `tasks/todo.md`.** Plan mode enforces read-only exploration and a formal approval dialog before any edits. Use it for non-trivial tasks alongside `tasks/todo.md` (the todo file is the durable artifact, plan mode is the gate).
28. **Inversion thinking belongs in the plan itself, not just in the code.** For every task, list what will break, then invert each failure mode into the solution. This is more useful than a flat task list because it catches hidden assumptions before implementation.
29. **Commit large-file state to disk early, not at the end of a task.** Long sessions with many file edits can run out of context. Writing PLAN.md, presentation.md, etc. as soon as they're drafted (not buffered in chat) prevents losing work when context fills.
