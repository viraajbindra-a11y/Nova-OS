# Astrion OS — First-Boot Install Prompt (M0.P4)
#
# Runs from .xinitrc BEFORE nova-shell starts. Detects whether we're
# running from the live ISO (not installed), and if so shows a zenity
# dialog asking the user if they want to install to disk.
#
# Three choices:
#   1) Install now           → runs `sudo nova-install` in xterm
#   2) Try it first          → skips install, continues to nova-shell,
#                              but doesn't set the "don't ask" flag
#   3) Never ask again       → writes a flag file so this script no-ops
#                              on future boots (useful for test VMs)
#
# The script is idempotent: if the user picks "never ask", or if we're
# already installed (not live), it exits immediately so nova-shell
# starts without delay.

You're running Astrion OS from a live USB. Changes you make now
will NOT be saved when you reboot.

<b>Install Astrion to your disk</b> so you can keep your settings,
files, and installed apps. The installer takes about 5 minutes
and requires an empty disk (or one you can wipe).

<i>You can also try Astrion first without installing — changes
just won't persist. Or pick 'Never ask again' to skip this
prompt on future live boots.</i>" \
